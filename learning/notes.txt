 row: observation, sample, example, instance, record
 column : feature, attribute, input, independent variable,  predictor, regressor, covariate (column header = feature name)
 column target : label, target, response, dependent variable, outcome ( "each unique value" in column target = target names)
 
 classification - unordered, categorical
 regression - ordered, continuous
 
 scikit-learn estimator : model, instantiate (relationship between X and y)
 
 underfit-bias, overfit-variance
 
	0	1   (Predict)
0	TN	FP  (Type I error)
1	FN	TP   (Type II)
(Act)

Precision (If +ve predicted how often correct actual)		TP/(TP+FP)
Recall/Sensitivity (TPR) (If +ve actual, how ofetn correctly predicted) 	TP/TP+FN
Specificity (If -ve actual, how ofetn correctly predicted) 	TN/TN+FP
FalsePositiveRate (1-Specificity) (If -ve actual, how ofetn incorrect predicted) 	FP/TN+FP

Recall/Sensitivity-fraud where FP acceptable than FN
Precision/Specificity-spam where FN acceptable than FP

F-1 score = Harmonic Mean (Precision, Recall) 2xy/(x+y)

R2 score close to 1 good model

Increase Sensitivity (and decrease Specificity) by decreasing Threshold

ROC Curve to choose Threshold FPR vs TPR)

Higher AUC (area under ROC) better
